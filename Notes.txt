=> but what if we have 20  different pages do we need to create all the pages and copy this whole code and paste all the time

TODO: lecture 14: First we get the info about how the get the info about any array or string using var_dump
=> Then we realize we need to do all the time all this process so we stored it inside the dd function and then we can use it by just caling that function
=> Then we learn little bit about super global varibale
==> Now, we want to change the css of the page according to which page we are
=>  For that we get the url from server super globale varibale and then accroding to the url we change it

==> Now, one more problemm arrives we need to pass al the function inside all the pages we have
=> For that we created the function direrectory and use it whereever we want
